      <description>
      The &lt;a href=&quot;https://jami.net/&quot;&gt;Jami&lt;/a&gt; communication tool has released a major new stable version called &quot;Taranis&quot;; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jami.net/taranis-a-major-release-of-jami/&quot;&gt;blog post announcement&lt;/a&gt; explains: &quot;&lt;span&gt;Taranis, the Gallic and Celtic god of the sky, lightning and thunder, will be the baptismal name of this new version of Jami.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;  The mailing-list announcement describes the tool this way:
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
Jami is a GNU package for universal communication that respects the
freedom and privacy of its users.  Jami is an end-to-end encrypted
secure and distributed voice, video, and chat communication platform
that requires no central server, and leaves the power of privacy and
freedom in the hands of users.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://jami.net/the-jami-conferencing-system/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; gives an overview of Jami for video conferences. The new release has improvements throughout the system, including the first phase of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jami.net/swarm-introducing-a-new-generation-of-group-conversations/&quot;&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt; support, which are &quot;&lt;span&gt;fully distributed, peer-to-peer chats with conversation
    histories synchronized across your devices, and the potential to
    be expanded into group chats in upcoming future releases of Jami&lt;/span&gt;&quot;.

      <title>Systemd 250 released</title>

      <dc:date>2021-12-23T23:46:33+00:00</dc:date>
      <dc:creator>corbet</dc:creator>
      <description>
      Systemd 250 has been released.  To say that the list of new features is
long would be a severe understatement; the developers have clearly been
busy.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;

	systemd-homed now makes use of UID mapped mounts for the home areas.
          If the kernel and used file system support it, files are now
          internally owned by the &quot;nobody&quot; user (i.e. the user typically used
          for indicating &quot;this ownership is not mapped&quot;), and dynamically
          mapped to the UID used locally on the system via the UID mapping
          mount logic of recent kernels. This makes migrating home areas
          between different systems cheaper because recursively chown()ing file
          system trees is no longer necessary.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(See &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/837566/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; for a description of
ID-mapped mounts).

      <title>Wrangling the typing PEPs</title>

      <description>
      When last we looked in on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/866613/&quot;&gt;great typing PEP
debate&lt;/a&gt; for Python, back in August, two PEPs were still being
discussed as alternatives for handling annotations in the language.
The steering council was considering the issue after deferring on a
decision for the Python&amp;nbsp;3.10 release, but the question has been
deferred again for Python&amp;nbsp;3.11.  More study is needed and the council
is looking for help from the Python community to guide its
decision.  In the meantime, though, discussion about the deferral has led
to the understanding that annotations are not a general-purpose feature,
but are only meant for typing information.  In addition, there is a growing
realization that typing information is effectively becoming mandatory
for Python libraries.

      Adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/790185/&quot;&gt;fs-verity&lt;/a&gt; file-integrity information
to RPM packages for Fedora&amp;nbsp;36 is the 
topic of a recent discussion on the Fedora devel mailing list.  The feature
would provide a means to install files from RPM packages as read-only files
that cannot be read or otherwise operated on if the data in the files changes
at any point.  The proposal is mostly about making the plumbing available
for use cases that are not particularly clear—which has led to some
questions and skepticism among those participating in the thread.

      Email is often seen as a technology with a dim future; it is slow, easily
faked, and buried in spam.  Kids These Days want nothing to do with it, and
email has lost its charm with many others as well.
But many development projects are still dependent on it, and even
non-developers still cope with large volumes of mail.  While development
forges show one possible path away from email, they are not the only one.
What if new structures could be built on top of email to address some of
its worst problems while keeping the good parts that many projects depend
on?  The &quot;lei&quot; system recently launched by Konstantin Ryabitsev is a hint
of how such a future might look.

      Regressions are no fun; among other things, finding the source of a
regression among thousands of changes can be a needle-in-the-haystack sort
of problem.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;git
bisect&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
command can help; it is a (relatively) easy way to sift through 
large numbers of commits to find the one that introduces a regression.  When it
works well, it can quickly point out the change that causes a specific
problem.  Bisection is not a perfect tool, though; it can go badly wrong in
situations where a bug cannot be reliably reproduced.  In an attempt to
make bisection more useful in such cases, Jan Kara is proposing to &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/git/20211118164940.8818-1-jack@suse.cz/&quot;&gt;add &quot;stochastic
bisection&quot; support&lt;/a&gt; to Git.

      The Spectre class of vulnerabilities was given that name because, it was
thought, these problems would haunt us for a long time.  As the fourth
anniversary of &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/742702/&quot;&gt;the disclosure of Meltdown and
Spectre&lt;/a&gt; approaches, there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of that
name.  One of 
the more recent Spectre variants goes by the name &quot;straight-line
speculation&quot;; it was first disclosed in June 2020, but fixes are still
trying to find their way into the compilers and the kernel.

      The Linux Foundation has &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/addressing-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-2021-and-beyond/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;
the posting of a report on its research into diversity, equity, and
inclusion in open-source communities.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
The research shows that while
a majority of respondents feel welcome in open source, many in
underrepresented communities do not. We hope that the data and insights
that this project provides will be a catalyst for strengthening existing
DEI initiatives and creating new ones.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The full report can be downloaded from &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.linuxfoundation.org/tools/the-2021-linux-foundation-report-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-open-source/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.
