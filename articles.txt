      The kernel's thread model is relatively straightforward and performs
reasonably well, but that's not enough for all users.  Specifically, there
are use cases out there that benefit from a lightweight threading model
that gives user space control over scheduling decisions.  Back in May 2021,
Peter Oskolkov posted a patch set implementing an abstraction known as &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20210520183614.1227046-1-posk@google.com/&quot;&gt;user-managed
concurrency groups&lt;/a&gt;, or UMCG.  Several revisions later, many observers
still lack a clear idea of what this patch is supposed to do, much less
whether it is a good idea for the kernel.  Things have taken a turn,
though, with Peter Zijlstra's &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20211214204445.665580974@infradead.org/&quot;&gt;reimplementation
of UMCG&lt;/a&gt;.

      It may have seemed questionable at times, but we have indeed survived yet
another year — LWN's 22nd year of publication.  That can only mean one
thing: it is time to take a look back at &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/840632/&quot;&gt;our
ill-advised attempt to make predictions&lt;/a&gt; in January and see how it all
worked out.  Shockingly, some of those predictions were at least partially
on the mark.  Others were&amp;nbsp;... not quite so good.

      Back at the beginning of 2020, it was &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/808260/&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that retirements would increase
during this decade.  In 2021, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/840632/&quot;&gt;the prediction&lt;/a&gt;
was that retirements would increase over the next couple of years. It is
happening and LWN is no exception.  I am retiring at the end of this year
after more than 20 years with LWN.
&lt;p&gt;
So who am I and how did I get here?  To some, I'm a name at the bottom of
some LWN page. To a few, I'm the one that reminds them when their LWN group
subscription is about to expire. You might have even met me at a
conference. Not that I have been to very many.  Mostly I tend to be quietly
in the background watching the LWN mailbox, looking for brief items and
quotes of the week (sorry I haven't found much lately), proofreading
articles, managing subscriptions, and more. But I'm older than most of you
and this is my last LWN weekly edition.  Getting here is a bit of story.

      <description>
      Fedora is among the group of Linux distributions that, by default, lock
out the root account such that it does not have a password and cannot be
logged into.  But, traditionally, &quot;rescue mode&quot; boots the system into
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-user_mode&quot;&gt;single-user
mode&lt;/a&gt;, which requires a root password—difficult to provide if it 
does not exist.  A Fedora proposal to remove the need for the password in
that case, and just drop into a root shell, does not seem likely to go far
in that form,
but it would seem to have pointed toward some better solutions for the
underlying problem.

      A clarion call from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/878454/&quot;&gt;warning about&lt;/a&gt; upcoming changes to the Chrome
browser's extension API was not the first such—from the EFF or from
others.  The time of the switch to &lt;a
href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nPu6Wy4LWR66EFLeYInl3NzzhHzc-qnk4w4PX-0XMw8/edit#&quot;&gt;Manifest
V3&lt;/a&gt;, as the new API is known, is growing closer; privacy advocates are
concerned that it will preclude a number of techniques that browser
extensions use for features like ad and tracker blocking.  Part of the
concern stems from the fact that Google is both the developer of a popular
web browser and the operator of an enormous advertising network so its
incentives seem, at least, plausibly misaligned.

      <title>SA_IMMUTABLE and the hazards of messing with signals</title>

      <description>
      There are some parts of the kernel where even the most experienced and
capable developers fear to tread; one of those is surely the code that
implements signals.  The nature of the signal API almost guarantees that
any implementation will be full of subtle interactions and complexities,
and the version in Linux doesn't disappoint.  So the inclusion of a
signal-handling change late in the 5.16 merge window might have been
expected to have the potential for difficulties; it didn't disappoint
either.

      By now, most readers will likely have seen something about the &lt;a

vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; that has been making life miserable for system administrators
since its disclosure on December&amp;nbsp;9.  This bug is relatively easy to
exploit, results in remote code execution, and lurks on servers all across
the net; it is not hyperbolic to call it one of the worst vulnerabilities
that has been disclosed in some years.  In a sense, the lessons from Log4j
have little new to teach us, but this bug does highlight some problems in
the free-software ecosystem in an unambiguous way.

      The &lt;a href=&quot;https://jami.net/&quot;&gt;Jami&lt;/a&gt; communication tool has released a major new stable version called &quot;Taranis&quot;; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jami.net/taranis-a-major-release-of-jami/&quot;&gt;blog post announcement&lt;/a&gt; explains: &quot;&lt;span&gt;Taranis, the Gallic and Celtic god of the sky, lightning and thunder, will be the baptismal name of this new version of Jami.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;  The mailing-list announcement describes the tool this way:
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
Jami is a GNU package for universal communication that respects the
freedom and privacy of its users.  Jami is an end-to-end encrypted
secure and distributed voice, video, and chat communication platform
that requires no central server, and leaves the power of privacy and
freedom in the hands of users.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://jami.net/the-jami-conferencing-system/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; gives an overview of Jami for video conferences. The new release has improvements throughout the system, including the first phase of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jami.net/swarm-introducing-a-new-generation-of-group-conversations/&quot;&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt; support, which are &quot;&lt;span&gt;fully distributed, peer-to-peer chats with conversation
    histories synchronized across your devices, and the potential to
    be expanded into group chats in upcoming future releases of Jami&lt;/span&gt;&quot;.

      <description>
      Systemd 250 has been released.  To say that the list of new features is
long would be a severe understatement; the developers have clearly been
busy.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;

	systemd-homed now makes use of UID mapped mounts for the home areas.
          If the kernel and used file system support it, files are now
          internally owned by the &quot;nobody&quot; user (i.e. the user typically used
          for indicating &quot;this ownership is not mapped&quot;), and dynamically
          mapped to the UID used locally on the system via the UID mapping
          mount logic of recent kernels. This makes migrating home areas
          between different systems cheaper because recursively chown()ing file
          system trees is no longer necessary.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(See &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/837566/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; for a description of
ID-mapped mounts).

      When last we looked in on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/866613/&quot;&gt;great typing PEP
debate&lt;/a&gt; for Python, back in August, two PEPs were still being
discussed as alternatives for handling annotations in the language.
The steering council was considering the issue after deferring on a
decision for the Python&amp;nbsp;3.10 release, but the question has been
deferred again for Python&amp;nbsp;3.11.  More study is needed and the council
is looking for help from the Python community to guide its
decision.  In the meantime, though, discussion about the deferral has led
to the understanding that annotations are not a general-purpose feature,
but are only meant for typing information.  In addition, there is a growing
realization that typing information is effectively becoming mandatory
for Python libraries.

for use cases that are not particularly clear—which has led to some
questions and skepticism among those participating in the thread.

      Email is often seen as a technology with a dim future; it is slow, easily
faked, and buried in spam.  Kids These Days want nothing to do with it, and
email has lost its charm with many others as well.
But many development projects are still dependent on it, and even
non-developers still cope with large volumes of mail.  While development
forges show one possible path away from email, they are not the only one.
What if new structures could be built on top of email to address some of
its worst problems while keeping the good parts that many projects depend
on?  The &quot;lei&quot; system recently launched by Konstantin Ryabitsev is a hint
of how such a future might look.

      <title>Stochastic bisection in Git</title>

      Regressions are no fun; among other things, finding the source of a
regression among thousands of changes can be a needle-in-the-haystack sort
of problem.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;git
bisect&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
command can help; it is a (relatively) easy way to sift through 
large numbers of commits to find the one that introduces a regression.  When it
works well, it can quickly point out the change that causes a specific
problem.  Bisection is not a perfect tool, though; it can go badly wrong in
situations where a bug cannot be reliably reproduced.  In an attempt to
make bisection more useful in such cases, Jan Kara is proposing to &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/git/20211118164940.8818-1-jack@suse.cz/&quot;&gt;add &quot;stochastic
bisection&quot; support&lt;/a&gt; to Git.

      The Spectre class of vulnerabilities was given that name because, it was
thought, these problems would haunt us for a long time.  As the fourth
anniversary of &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/742702/&quot;&gt;the disclosure of Meltdown and
Spectre&lt;/a&gt; approaches, there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of that
name.  One of 
the more recent Spectre variants goes by the name &quot;straight-line
speculation&quot;; it was first disclosed in June 2020, but fixes are still
trying to find their way into the compilers and the kernel.

      The Linux Foundation has &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/addressing-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-2021-and-beyond/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;
the posting of a report on its research into diversity, equity, and
inclusion in open-source communities.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
The research shows that while
a majority of respondents feel welcome in open source, many in
underrepresented communities do not. We hope that the data and insights
that this project provides will be a catalyst for strengthening existing
DEI initiatives and creating new ones.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The full report can be downloaded from &lt;a
